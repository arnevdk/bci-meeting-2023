  abstract  = {Objective. Covariance matrices of noisy multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) time series data provide essential information for the decoding of brain signals using machine learning methods. However, small datasets and high dimensionality make it hard to estimate these matrices. In brain–computer interfaces (BCI) based on event-related potentials (ERP) and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier, the state of the art covariance estimation uses shrinkage regularization. As this is a general covariance regularization approach, we aim at improving LDA further by better exploiting the domain-specific characteristics of the EEG to regularize the covariance estimates. Approach. We propose to enforce a block-Toeplitz structure for the covariance matrix of the LDA, which implements an assumption of signal stationarity in short time windows for each channel. Main results. An offline re-analysis of data collected from 213 subjects under 13 different event-related potential BCI protocols showed a significantly increased binary classification performance of this ‘ToeplitzLDA’ compared to shrinkage regularized LDA (up to 6 AUC points, p {\textless} 0.001) and Riemannian classification approaches (up to 2 AUC points, p {\textless} 0.001). In an unsupervised visual speller application, this improvement would translate to a relative reduction of spelling errors by 81\% on average for 25 subjects. Additionally, aside from lower memory and reduced time complexity for LDA training, ToeplitzLDA proves to be robust against drastic increases of the number of temporal features. Significance. The proposed covariance estimation allows BCI researchers to improve classification rates and reduce calibration times of BCI protocols using event-related potentials and thus support the usability of corresponding applications. Its lower computational and memory needs could make it a valuable algorithm especially for mobile BCIs.},

  abstract  = {Objective. Several ERP-based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) that can be controlled even without eye movements (covert attention) have been recently proposed. However, when compared to similar systems based on overt attention, they displayed significantly lower accuracy. In the current interpretation, this is ascribed to the absence of the contribution of short-latency visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in the tasks performed in the covert attention modality. This study aims to investigate if this decrement (i) is fully explained by the lack of VEP contribution to the classification accuracy; (ii) correlates with lower temporal stability of the single-trial P300 potentials elicited in the covert attention modality. Approach. We evaluated the latency jitter of P300 evoked potentials in three BCI interfaces exploiting either overt or covert attention modalities in 20 healthy subjects. The effect of attention modality on the P300 jitter, and the relative contribution of VEPs and P300 jitter to the classification accuracy have been analyzed. Main results. The P300 jitter is higher when the BCI is controlled in covert attention. Classification accuracy negatively correlates with jitter. Even disregarding short-latency VEPs, overt-attention BCI yields better accuracy than covert. When the latency jitter is compensated offline, the difference between accuracies is not significant. Significance. The lower temporal stability of the P300 evoked potential generated during the tasks performed in covert attention modality should be regarded as the main contributing explanation of lower accuracy of covert-attention ERP-based BCIs.},

Previous work has demonstrated that latency jitter, the variation in timing of the brain responses, plays a critical role in determining BCI performance. In this study, we used Classifier-Based Latency Estimation (CBLE) and a wavelet transform to provide information about latency jitter to a second-level classifier. Three second-level classifiers were tested: least squares (LS), step-wise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA), and support vector machine (SVM). Of these three, LS and SWLDA performed better than the original online classifier. The resulting combination demonstrated improved detection of brain responses for many participants, resulting in better BCI performance. Interestingly, the performance gain was greatest for those individuals for whom the BCI did not work well online, indicating that this method may be most suitable for improving performance of otherwise marginal participants.},

  abstract  = {The present review systematically examines the literature reporting gaze independent interaction modalities in non-invasive brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication. BCIs measure signals related to specific brain activity and translate them into device control signals. This technology can be used to provide users with severe motor disability (e.g. late stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); acquired brain injury) with an assistive device that does not rely on muscular contraction. Most of the studies on BCIs explored mental tasks and paradigms using visual modality. Considering that in ALS patients the oculomotor control can deteriorate and also other potential users could have impaired visual function, tactile and auditory modalities have been investigated over the past years to seek alternative BCI systems which are independent from vision. In addition, various attentional mechanisms, such as covert attention and feature-directed attention, have been investigated to develop gaze independent visual-based BCI paradigms. Three areas of research were considered in the present review: (i) auditory BCIs, (ii) tactile BCIs and (iii) independent visual BCIs. Out of a total of 130 search results, 34 articles were selected on the basis of pre-defined exclusion criteria. Thirteen articles dealt with independent visual BCIs, 15 reported on auditory BCIs and the last six on tactile BCIs, respectively. From the review of the available literature, it can be concluded that a crucial point is represented by the trade-off between BCI systems/paradigms with high accuracy and speed, but highly demanding in terms of attention and memory load, and systems requiring lower cognitive effort but with a limited amount of communicable information. These issues should be considered as priorities to be explored in future studies to meet users’ requirements in a real-life scenario.},

The objective of this work was to investigate the role that latency jitter plays in BCI classification. Approach. We developed a novel method, classifier-based latency estimation (CBLE), based on a generalization of Woody filtering. The technique works by presenting the time-shifted data to the classifier, and using the time shift that corresponds to the maximal classifier score. Main results. The variance of CBLE estimates correlates significantly (p {\textless} 10-42) with BCI accuracy in the Farwell–Donchin BCI paradigm. Additionally, CBLE predicts same-day accuracy, even from small datasets or datasets that have already been used for classifier training, better than the accuracy on the small dataset (p {\textless} 0.05). The technique should be relatively classifier-independent, and the results were confirmed on two linear classifiers. Significance. The results suggest that latency jitter may be an important cause of poor BCI performance, and methods that correct for latency jitter may improve that performance. CBLE can also be used to decrease the amount of data needed for accuracy estimation, allowing research on effects with shorter timescales.},

  abstract  = {Background

In a visual oddball paradigm, attention to an event usually modulates the event-related potential (ERP). An ERP-based
 brain-computer interface (BCI) exploits this neural mechanism for communication. Hitherto, it was unclear to what
 extent the accuracy of such a BCI requires eye movements (overt attention) or whether it is also feasible for
 targets in the visual periphery (covert attention). Also unclear was how the visual design of the BCI can be
 improved to meet peculiarities of peripheral vision such as low spatial acuity and crowding.

Method

Healthy participants (N = 13) performed a copy-spelling task wherein they had to count target intensifications. EEG
 and eye movements were recorded concurrently. First, (c)overt attention was investigated by way of a target
 fixation condition and a central fixation condition. In the latter, participants had to fixate a dot in the
 center of the screen and allocate their attention to a target in the visual periphery. Second, the effect of
 visual speller layout was investigated by comparing the symbol Matrix to an ERP-based Hex-o-Spell, a two-levels
 speller consisting of six discs arranged on an invisible hexagon.

Results

We assessed counting errors, ERP amplitudes, and offline classification performance. There is an advantage (i.e.,
 less errors, larger ERP amplitude modulation, better classification) of overt attention over covert attention,
 and there is also an advantage of the Hex-o-Spell over the Matrix. Using overt attention, P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3
 components are enhanced by attention. Using covert attention, only N2 and P3 are enhanced for both spellers, and
 N1 and P2 are modulated when using the Hex-o-Spell but not when using the Matrix. Consequently, classifiers rely
 mainly on early evoked potentials in overt attention and on later cognitive components in covert attention.

Conclusions

Both overt and covert attention can be used to drive an ERP-based BCI, but performance is markedly lower for covert
 attention. The Hex-o-Spell outperforms the Matrix, especially when eye movements are not permitted, illustrating
 that performance can be increased if one accounts for peculiarities of peripheral vision.},

  abstract  = {The usability of EEG-based visual brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) based on event-related potentials (ERPs) benefits from reducing the calibration time before BCI operation. Linear decoding models, such as the spatiotemporal beamformer model, yield state-of-the-art accuracy. Although the training time of this model is generally low, it can require a substantial amount of training data to reach functional performance. Hence, BCI calibration sessions should be sufficiently long to provide enough training data. This work introduces two regularized estimators for the beamformer weights. The first estimator uses cross-validated L2-regularization. The second estimator exploits prior information about the structure of the EEG by assuming Kronecker–Toeplitz-structured covariance. The performances of these estimators are validated and compared with the original spatiotemporal beamformer and a Riemannian-geometry-based decoder using a BCI dataset with P300-paradigm recordings for 21 subjects. Our results show that the introduced estimators are well-conditioned in the presence of limited training data and improve ERP classification accuracy for unseen data. Additionally, we show that structured regularization results in lower training times and memory usage, and a more interpretable classification model.},
