  abstract  = {Objective. Covariance matrices of noisy multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) time series data provide essential information for the decoding of brain signals using machine learning methods. However, small datasets and high dimensionality make it hard to estimate these matrices. In brain–computer interfaces (BCI) based on event-related potentials (ERP) and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier, the state of the art covariance estimation uses shrinkage regularization. As this is a general covariance regularization approach, we aim at improving LDA further by better exploiting the domain-specific characteristics of the EEG to regularize the covariance estimates. Approach. We propose to enforce a block-Toeplitz structure for the covariance matrix of the LDA, which implements an assumption of signal stationarity in short time windows for each channel. Main results. An offline re-analysis of data collected from 213 subjects under 13 different event-related potential BCI protocols showed a significantly increased binary classification performance of this ‘ToeplitzLDA’ compared to shrinkage regularized LDA (up to 6 AUC points, p {\textless} 0.001) and Riemannian classification approaches (up to 2 AUC points, p {\textless} 0.001). In an unsupervised visual speller application, this improvement would translate to a relative reduction of spelling errors by 81\% on average for 25 subjects. Additionally, aside from lower memory and reduced time complexity for LDA training, ToeplitzLDA proves to be robust against drastic increases of the number of temporal features. Significance. The proposed covariance estimation allows BCI researchers to improve classification rates and reduce calibration times of BCI protocols using event-related potentials and thus support the usability of corresponding applications. Its lower computational and memory needs could make it a valuable algorithm especially for mobile BCIs.},

  abstract  = {Objective. Several ERP-based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) that can be controlled even without eye movements (covert attention) have been recently proposed. However, when compared to similar systems based on overt attention, they displayed significantly lower accuracy. In the current interpretation, this is ascribed to the absence of the contribution of short-latency visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in the tasks performed in the covert attention modality. This study aims to investigate if this decrement (i) is fully explained by the lack of VEP contribution to the classification accuracy; (ii) correlates with lower temporal stability of the single-trial P300 potentials elicited in the covert attention modality. Approach. We evaluated the latency jitter of P300 evoked potentials in three BCI interfaces exploiting either overt or covert attention modalities in 20 healthy subjects. The effect of attention modality on the P300 jitter, and the relative contribution of VEPs and P300 jitter to the classification accuracy have been analyzed. Main results. The P300 jitter is higher when the BCI is controlled in covert attention. Classification accuracy negatively correlates with jitter. Even disregarding short-latency VEPs, overt-attention BCI yields better accuracy than covert. When the latency jitter is compensated offline, the difference between accuracies is not significant. Significance. The lower temporal stability of the P300 evoked potential generated during the tasks performed in covert attention modality should be regarded as the main contributing explanation of lower accuracy of covert-attention ERP-based BCIs.},

  abstract  = {Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer restoration of communication to those with the most severe movement impairments, but performance is not yet ideal. Previous work has demonstrated that latency jitter, the variation in timing of the brain responses, plays a critical role in determining BCI performance. In this study, we used Classifier-Based Latency Estimation (CBLE) and a wavelet transform to provide information about latency jitter to a second-level classifier. Three second-level classifiers were tested: least squares (LS), step-wise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA), and support vector machine (SVM). Of these three, LS and SWLDA performed better than the original online classifier. The resulting combination demonstrated improved detection of brain responses for many participants, resulting in better BCI performance. Interestingly, the performance gain was greatest for those individuals for whom the BCI did not work well online, indicating that this method may be most suitable for improving performance of otherwise marginal participants.},
